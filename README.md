Matrix!

You can keep track of this project's development
[here](https://codeberg.org/VnPower/PixivFE/wiki/Things-to-do).

## Features

- Lightweight - both the interface and the code
- Privacy-first - the server will do the work for you
- No bloat - we only serve HTML and CSS
- Open source - you can trust me!

## Hosting

You can use PixivFE for personal use! Assuming that you use an operating system that can run POSIX shell scripts, install `go`, clone this repository, modify the `run.sh` file, and profit!
I recommend self-hosting your own instance for personal use, instead of relying entirely on official instances.


Check out [this page](https://codeberg.org/VnPower/pixivfe/wiki/Hosting). We
currently have guides for Docker and Caddy.
