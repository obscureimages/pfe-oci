A privacy-respecting alternative front-end for Pixiv that doesn't suck

## What is this?

I have been researching about Pixiv's API for a long time (with a lot of problems).
One thing I noticed is that somebody actually made a decent alternative front-end for Pixiv yet
(actually, there are some, but mostly [paid + feature less](https://pixiv.moe) and/or made by Chinese and/or depends on JS).

I decided to take the lead by creating an actual front-end that is truly suckless that could access most of the features provided by Pixiv.
Intended to be written in Go with [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com).

Note that this project is still under its preparation stage.
